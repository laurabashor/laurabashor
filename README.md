## About me 

I completed my PhD in Microbiology in the VandeWoude Lab at Colorado State University in August 2024, where my dissertation work focused on SARS-CoV-2 evolution following cross-species transmission. I'm broadly interested in infectious diseases, one health, genomics & bioinformatics approaches, and data management & visualization.
